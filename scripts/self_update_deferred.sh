# self_update_deferred.sh — GitOps Auto-Update Script (Drain & Purge Pattern)
# =============================================================================
#
# This script is designed to be called by a CI runner (GitHub Actions, self-hosted)
# running ON the headnode via the cluster-ci-admin tag. It performs a safe
# pre-emptive update of the cluster:
#
#   1. Enable Maintenance Mode (rejets new jobs)
#   2. Purge active jobs (Drain & Purge)
#   3. Pull latest code on the headnode
#   4. Sync dependencies
#   5. Signal ALL workers to update via their webhook
#   6. Schedule a deferred restart of headnode services (after script exits)
#   7. Exit 0 immediately — the CI reports success before the restart happens
#
# THE TRICK: If we restart the headnode services while this script is running,
# we kill the GitHub Actions runner that launched us. By scheduling the restart
# in a detached background process with a 10s delay, we exit cleanly first.
