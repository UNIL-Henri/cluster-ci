## Headnode/Worker Topology and Dynamic Scheduling

### Context
To optimize hardware resource utilization (specifically Lenovo ThinkStation machines), the system is evolving towards an asymmetric topology.

### Roles
- **Headnode (desi):** Acts as the single entry point for CI. It hosts the Scheduler and manages the job queue.
- **Workers (Lenovo):** Machines dedicated to execution. They report their state (available RAM) to the Headnode and execute assigned jobs.

### Scheduling (Bin-Packing)
Job allocation relies on a **Bin-Packing** algorithm based on unified memory (RAM).
1. The job declares its RAM requirement (via `.cluster-ci`).
2. The scheduler maintains a real-time view of available RAM on each Worker.
3. The job is assigned to the first Worker with enough available RAM, or queued if no resources are free.

### Isolation and Protection (Software Memory Watchdog)
To ensure Worker stability, each job is monitored by a **Software Watchdog** based on the `psutil` library.

- **Recursive Measurement:** At regular intervals (every 2 seconds), the Worker calculates the sum of physical memory (RSS) of the computing process and all its child processes (e.g., DVC sub-processes).
- **UX Interruption:** If the sum exceeds the RAM limit declared in `.cluster-ci`, the Worker immediately kills the process tree.
- **GitHub Feedback:** An explicit error message is displayed on standard error (stderr), allowing the researcher to know exactly why their job failed and how much RAM was consumed relative to their reservation.
